## Approach & Efficiency
Approach: iterate through list and add at either end or before/after desired node
Efficiency: O(n) has will need to go through entire list every time

## Solution
- `pytest ./tests/code_challenges/test_linked_list_insertions.py`
- This runs the tests for the code
- This code is not set up to be run as main at the moment

## Files
- [code](../data_structures/linked_list.py)
- [tests](../tests/code_challenges/test_linked_list_insertions.py)
